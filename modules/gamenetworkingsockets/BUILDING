Before being able to compile Godot with this module the GameNetworkingSockets library needs to be compiled separately because configuring it inside SCons is too much of a hassle for me.

----- Windows -----

Open a Visual Studio command prompt from the GameNetworkingSockets directory next to this file.

> git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
> .\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
> cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DUSE_STEAMWEBRTC=ON
> cd build
> ninja
> copy .\src\GameNetworkingSockets.lib .\..\..\..\..\GameNetworkingSockets.<platform>.<target>.[dev].<arch>.[mono].lib

(e.g. copy .\src\GameNetworkingSockets.lib .\..\..\GameNetworkingSockets.windows.editor.x86_64.lib)

Then compile Godot like usual. Don't forget to add the shared libraries to the Godot executable.
